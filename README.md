# 📏 Euclidean Distance Calculator

This simple Python script calculates the **Euclidean distance** between all pairs of points in a given list and prints the **minimum distance** found.

## 🔢 Features

- Calculates distances between all point pairs
- Identifies and displays the shortest distance

## 🧮 Formula Used

Euclidean Distance:

```
√((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python distance_calculator.py
```

## 📌 Example Output

```
Minimum Distance: 1.4142135623730951
```

## 📁 Input Data

```python
points = [(1, 2), (4, 6), (7, 1), (3, 3), (2, 5)]
```
